# Knovatu Organization

This is the official repository of [Knovatu](https://knovatu.info/), a website created with the idea of sharing content about technologies, whether about programming languages, software, technologies, cultures, tips, or any other topics related to the world of technology.

We are a group of people who like collaborative work, so if you feel like contributing any content related to technology, choosing a topic, and developing your idea, you are always welcome here.

**Byte Maze** is a static website built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). All content is generated using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). You can use this [link](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#blockquote) to learn more about this lightweight markup language.

<br/>

> :warning: &nbsp; **All content on this website must be written in English. Texts written in another language will not be accepted.**

<br/>

If you dare to collaborate with this project, you must follow these steps:

1. ALL COMMITS MADE MUST BE DESCRIBED WITH A CLEAR MESSAGE AND FOLLOW THE [CONVENTIONAL COMMITS](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) MESSAGE STRUCTURE.
2. To start, you have to create a new branch from the main branch, with the following name: `doc/document-name`
3. Add you personal information in the `data/authors.yml` file.
4. Create a new markdown file inside the `_posts/` folder with the following name: `<publication-date>-<short-name>.md`, and write your article. Learn how to work with this [Jekyll Template](https://chirpy.cotes.page/).
5. After writing your article, go to the *Actions* tab and run the *Build-and-Deploy* workflow on your branch to check the **Build** of the website with your changes. The deployment will show you an error, this is normal because it is not possible to deploy the Website to another branch other than the Main one.
6. After the Build stage finishes successfully, you must submit the article through a *Pull Request* to be reviewed and published.
